## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our mission is to bring a new level of convenience and flexibility to customers through mobile ordering at local bars and restuarants. It is suited for the regular patrons of local nightlife in search of new bar experiences as well as visitors looking for the most popular haunts in the neighborhood. The application lists the menus of local restaurants in the users area. This app was designed for customers who want to visit their favorite bar on a Saturday night but the bar is packed and the bartender is swamped with orders. It allows the customer to place their order and quickly return to enjoying the rest of their night without having to wait an eternity standing at the bar. A well-organized ticketing system on the bar's end allows requests to be tracked and well-managed as orders are prepared.  

### Features
User login: users will be able to create accounts and log into the application. Users will be able to view their profile page. 
Ecommerce: users will be able to enter payment information which will then send an invoice to both the customer and the business. 
Product selection: using CRUD functionality, users will be able to add, edit, delete items from their cart. 
### Technologies
This application will be designed using Java and Spring Boot. The front-end will be designed using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap. The back-end of our project will use Hibernate and mySQL. 

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn Java authentication as well as how to enable location services through Google Maps API. I will have to design an internal ticketing system that sends an invoice to both the customer and the restaurant.
